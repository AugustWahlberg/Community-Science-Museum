Website for local science museum - Semester project 1, Noroff 2021

## Description
This is my semester project for my first semester at Noroff. In this project, I have created a website for the fictive costumer Community Science Museum. The website is made to appeal to both kids (7-15 years) and families with young children. All illustrations and the logo are self made.
